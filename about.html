        <p>My name is Matt Hartman, and I’m a writer and reporter from Durham, North Carolina. My work has appeared in <em>The Outline</em>, <em>Jacobin</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em>, the <em>Awl</em>, <em>In These Times</em>, <em>Scalawag</em>, and elsewhere. I mostly write cultural and political pieces focused on identity, place, and the way capitalist economic structures affect—well, everything. I also take on other projects that seem interesting and often turn out far more complicated than I was prepared for, like housing policy and designing this website.</p>
        <p>My writing (and thinking, I guess) is rooted in my background in philosophy and economics. I studied both at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as social and political theory as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, using post-Marxist political theory and ordinary language philosophy to investigate questions of political violence, theories of subjectivity, the role of criticism, and the connections between art and politics. More recently, I've been focused on the day-to-day experiences of organizers working to build a better world and the regular people suffering this one—which touches on all the same subjects I studied, but in a much more practical, much less grad school-y way.</p>
