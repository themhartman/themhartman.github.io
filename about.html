      <p>My name is Matt Hartman, and I’m a writer from Durham, North Carolina. My work has appeared in Jacobin, the Los Angeles Review of Books, the Awl, In These Times, Scalawag, and elsewhere. I mostly write cultural criticism and political commentaries focused on identity, place, and the way capitalist economic structures affect—well, everything. But I am also writing an increasing number of reported features on similar topics, as well as creative works.</p>
      <p>Most of my writing (and thinking, I guess) is rooted in my background as a philosophy student. I studied philosophy and economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and social and political theory the University of Chicago, focusing on post-Marxist political theory and ordinary language philosophy. More specifically, my studies covered questions of political violence, theories of subjectivity, the role of criticism, and the connections between art and politics.</p>
