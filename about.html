    <p>My name is Matt Hartman, and I’m a writer from Durham, North Carolina, whose work has appeared in <em>Jacobin</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em>, the <em>Awl</em>, <em>In These Times</em>, <em>Scalawag</em>, and elsewhere. I mostly write cultural criticism and political commentaries focused on identity, place, and the way capitalist economic structures affect—well, everything. I am also writing an increasing number of reported features on similar topics, as well as creative works.</p>
    <p>Most of my writing (and thinking, I guess) is rooted in my background in philosophy and economics. I studied both at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as social and political theory as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, with an emphasis on post-Marxist political theory and ordinary language philosophy. More specifically, my studies covered questions of political violence, theories of subjectivity, the role of criticism, and the connections between art and politics.</p>
