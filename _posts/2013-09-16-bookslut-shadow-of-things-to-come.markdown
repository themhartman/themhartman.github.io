_[The Shadow of Things to Come](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0857420992/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0857420992&linkCode=as2&tag=artandlies-20)_ is the story of a man surviving in an unnamed African nation. It follows him from childhood to a banal resistance to oppression to his flight from the country. It touches on the methods of control, the psychology of the oppressed, and the kinds of hope left for those who have no real chance of escape. And it speaks with such force and clarity that is cuts through the subject matter to speak about much more than exists in the novel's stark world.
