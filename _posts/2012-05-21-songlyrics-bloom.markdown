Bloom is aptly summed up in a few lines from “New Year”

<blockquote>Can you call it? See it coming?<br>
Just enough to tell a story ’bout a portrait<br>

Beach House‘s two members–Victoria Legrand and Alex Scully–combine to produce what will be seen as one of the year’s best albums. Their success comes from the fact that they act as a true pair: each plays on the other, pushing each other further and demonstrating both sides of a universal coin.

<blockquote>All you ever wanted<br>
is it getting in the way?</blockquote>
