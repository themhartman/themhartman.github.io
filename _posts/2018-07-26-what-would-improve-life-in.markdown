At core, it’s a simple idea: if you want to know what matters to people, what would make their lives better, just ask them.

Down Home North Carolina (DHNC) is charting a different path. Founded in 2017, the organization started with with a six-month listening canvass at Division of Social Services offices, Walmarts, food banks, and four thousand homes in low-income neighborhoods in North Carolina’s rural Alamance and Haywood Counties. Canvassers heard members of a multiracial, rural working class explain their concerns about meeting basic needs, their desire to come overcome divisions, and, above all, their willingness to fight for better conditions.
